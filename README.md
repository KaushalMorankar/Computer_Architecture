# Computer_Architecture

- This assignment aims to create a cache_simulator for RISCV archtecture which covers the LRU, FIFO,LFU and Random cache configurations.            
- Cache simulation along with memory storage and write policies for cache is also omplemented here.         
- Run `make` to create a binary.        
- Run `./riscv_sim` to run the program.            
- Enter the command `load filename.s` to load the assembly file.       
- Run `cache_sim enable cache.config` to enable the cache simulation.         
- Furthermore Enter step or run or various commands like invalidate etc to simulate -the cache and memory of RISCV architecture.
